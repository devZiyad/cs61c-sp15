        <p>
        There are two parts to this lab.  In the first part, you will be
        learning how to use the remaining essential parts of logisim, in particular, splitters to take a subset of bits on a wire, and to rejoin them. In the second part, you will prepare for your project part 1 by designing a basic ALU.

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
    For part A, start all Logisim circuits from scratch.  Feel free to do each exercise as separate sub-circuits in the same Logisim file.</p>
    <p>For part B, we've provided you with a starter Logisim circuit to start out.

    </div>

    <p>The following exercises will introduce you to more advanced techniques/concepts in Logisim.

    <h3>Exercise A.1: Splitters</h3>

    This is the last essential tool you will need in this class. To demonstrate its use you will construct a circuit that manipulates an 8-bit number.

    <ol>
      <li>Create a new subcircuit and name it "Ex1".
      <li>Add an 8-bit input pin to your circuit and label it.
      <li>Add a 1-bit output pin labeled "Out1" and an 8-bit output pin labeled "Out2" to your circuit.
      <li>Go to the Wiring folder and select the Splitter circuit. This circuit will take a wire and split it into a smaller set of wires. Conversely, it can also take many sets of wires and combine them into a larger bus.
      <li>Before you place your circuit, change the "Bit Width In" property (bus width) to 8, and "Fan Out" property (# of branches) to 3. If you move your cursor over the schematic, your cursor should look as follows: <img style="position:relative; top:5px;" src=splitter.gif>
      <li>Now, select which bits to send out to which part of your fan. The least significant bit is bit 0 and the most significant bit is bit 7. Change bits 1, 2, and 6 to be coming out on fan arm 1 (the middle one). FYI: the "None" option means that the selected bit will not come out on ANY of the fan arms.
      <li>Once you configure your splitter, you can place your splitter into your circuit.
      <li>Attach a 2-input AND gate to fan arms 0 and 2 and route the output of the AND gate to Out1.
      <li>Now we want Out2 to be the negative sign and magnitude value of the input.  The combinational logic should be straight-forward. For a quick intro to the sign and magnitude representation, check out <a class="reference" href="http://wikieducator.org/SIGN_AND_MAGNITUDE">this link</a>.
      <li>We will need another splitter to recombine the fans into a single 8-bit bus.  Place another splitter with the proper properties (Bit Width In: 8, Fan Out: 3, correct fan widths).  Play with the Facing and Appearance properties to make your final circuit as clean-looking as possible.
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="checkoff">Checkoff</a></h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>Show your Ex1 circuit to your TA.</li>
    	<li>Assuming 2's complement representation, what inputs will produce Out1 = 1?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercise A.2: Rotate Right</h3>
    With your knowledge of <strong>splitters</strong> and your knowledge and experience with multiplexers from the last lab, you are ready to implement a non-trivial combinational logic block: <code>rotr</code>, which stands for &quot;Rotate Right&quot;. The idea is that <code>rotr A,B</code> will &quot;rotate&quot; the bit pattern of input A to the right by B bits. So, if A were 0b10110101011<strong>10011</strong> and B were 0b0101 (5 in decimal), the output of the block would be 0b<strong>10011</strong>10110101011. Notice that the rightmost 5 bits were rotated off the right end of the value and back onto the left end. In RTL, the operation would be something like &quot;<code>R = A >> B | A << (16 - B)</code>&quot;.
    <p>
      You must implement a subcircuit named &quot;rotr&quot; with the following inputs:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong>, 16 bits, the input to be rotated</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>, 4 bits, the rotation amount (Why 4 bits?)</li>
      </ul>
      The output should be A rotated right by B bit positions, as outlined above. You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use Logisim shifters in your solution, though all other combinational logic (MUXes, constants, gates, adders, etc.) is allowed. Show off your <code>rotr</code> subcircuit in the main subcircuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hint:</b> Before you start wiring, you should think veeeery carefully about how you might decompose this problem into smaller ones and join them together. You should feel very free to use subcircuits when implementing <code>rotr</code>. If you don't, expect to regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hint, the second:</b> Just because we gave you an RTL representation doesn't mean it's the best way to look at this problem. Think about the input bits of <strong>B</strong> and think about how to effectively use <strong>splitters</strong>!
    <p>
      <b>Tip:</b> If your wiring from a large splitter is getting messy, sometimes chaining splitters can keep things more localized and cleaner.  For example, a 1 to 16 split can be achieved by a fan out of 4 connected to 4 more splitters of fan out 4.

      <h2>Advanced Logisim Features</h2>
      <p> Here are two more logisim features you will find useful. After reading about tunnels and extenders, begin part B below.
      </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Tunnels</h2>
        <p>A <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/base/tunnel.html">tunnel</a> allows you draw an "invisible wire" to bind two
          points together. Tunnels are grouped by case-sensitive
          labels give to a wire.  They are used to connect wires
          like so:</p>
        <img src="tunnels1.png">
        <p>Which has an effect such as the following:</p>
        <img src="tunnels2.png">
        <p>Some care should be taken as to which wires are connected with tunnels to
          which other wires, such as in this case:</p>
        <img src="tunnels3.png">
        <p>Which in turn has the following effect:</p>
        <img src="tunnels4.png">

        <p>
        We <em>strongly</em> recommend you use tunnels with Logisim, because they make your circuits much cleaner looking, and therefore easier to debug.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="section">
        <h2>Extenders</h2>
        <p>When changing the width of a wire, you should use a <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/base/extender.html">bit extender</a> for clarity.
          For example, consider the following implementation of extending an 8-bit wire
          into a 16-bit wire:</p>
        <img src="extend1.png">
        <p>Whereas the following is much simpler, easier to read, and less error-prone:</p>
        <img src="extend2.png">
        <p>Additionally consider the case of throwing out bits. In this example, an 8-bit
          wire is being converted into a 16-bit wire by throwing out the other bits:</p>
        <img src="extend3.png">
        <p>Despite the implications of its name, a bit extender can also do this same
          operation:</p>
        <img src="extend4.png">
      </div>

      <hr>

      <h3>Part B: Logisim ALU</h3>

      <p>In this exercise, you will first implement a 32 bit ALU in
      Logisim. Remember: we have provided a starter file!</p>

      <p>As a reminder, recall that ALU stands for <em>Arithmetic Logic Unit</em>. An
      ALU is a fundamental building block of a CPU (central
      processing unit) and it performs integer arithmetic and
      logical (bitwise) operations. The function that the ALU
      performs (e.g. add, xor) is determined by the control of our
      datapath, which is determined by the instruction the processor
      is executing. The ALU is highlighted in a simplified datapath diagram below:</p>

  <img src="alu.png" style="height:150px;width:auto">

      <p> This lab assignment is similar to the CPU design project (it
        is essentially a slightly simpler version of Project 2's ALU).
        Hopefully by getting a headstart here in lab, Project 2 will
        go a bit more smoothly!</p>

      <div class="section" id="functions">
        <p>The 8 functions that you will implement are: shift left logical, shift right
        logical, shift right arithmetic, rotate left, rotate right, and, or, and xor. The
        ALU will perform a desired function on 2 32-bit inputs and output the result. The
        selected function will be determined by the value of the control signal, as
        listed below.</p>

        <p>Here's what occurs for each operation:</p>

        <table border="1">
          <thead valign="bottom">
            <tr>
              <th>Control</th>
              <th>Operation</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody valign="top">
            <tr>
              <td>000</td>
              <td>Shift Left Logical</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>001</td>
              <td>Shift Right Logical</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>010</td>
              <td>Shift Right Arithmetic</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>011</td>
              <td>Rotate Left</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>100</td>
              <td>Rotate Right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>101</td>
              <td>And</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>110</td>
              <td>Inclusive Or</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>111</td>
              <td>Exclusive Or</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
